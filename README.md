# Data Analysis Project: Sales Analysis

![Project Logo](images/Project_Logo.PNG)

## Overview
This repository contains a data analysis project that focuses on analyzing sales data to gain valuable insights. The dataset consists of sales data from multiple months, and we aim to answer several business questions using Python's pandas library.

## Dataset
The data used for this analysis is available in the 'data' folder. It contains sales data in CSV format from different months, and we'll combine them into a single DataFrame for analysis.

## Project Structure
The repository is structured as follows:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset files used for analysis.
- **src/**: Contains the Jupyter Notebooks and Python scripts used for data analysis.
- **images/**: Reserved space for saving visualizations and graphs generated during analysis.
- **all_data.csv**: A CSV file created after preprocessing, containing the consolidated data.
- **requirements.txt**: Lists the Python libraries and their versions required for running the code.

## Installation
To run the code in this project, you'll need Python 3.x and the required libraries. You can install the necessary dependencies using the following command:



## Data Analysis
The project includes the following analyses:

### 1. Monthly Sales Analysis
We'll identify the best month for sales and visualize the sales amount per month.

### 2. City-wise Sales Analysis
We'll determine the city with the highest number of sales and create a bar chart to visualize the sales per city.

### 3. Time-based Analysis
We'll explore the best time to display ads to maximize the likelihood of customers buying products. The analysis will be visualized in a line plot.

### 4. Products Often Sold Together
We'll analyze the products that are often sold together, providing insights into cross-selling opportunities.

## Results and Visualizations
Here are some visualizations generated during the analysis:

## Acknowledgments
This project was completed by following the instructions and guidance provided in the YouTube channel by **Keith Galli**. Thank you for the insightful tutorials and practical data analysis techniques.

## Conclusion
Through this data analysis project, we gained valuable insights into the sales data. We identified the best month for sales, the city with the highest sales, the best time for displaying ads, and products that are often sold together. The findings can guide business decisions and strategies to improve sales and revenue.

Feel free to explore the code and analyses in the 'src/' folder.
